## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Third-party API changes**: Monitor API changelogs, add version checks
- **Rate limiting**: Implement exponential backoff, cache aggressively
- **Data consistency**: Add retry logic, dead letter queues

### Business Risks

- **Low conversion**: A/B test pricing, add free trial
- **High churn**: Improve onboarding, add more integrations
- **Competition**: Focus on niche (indie founders), build community
